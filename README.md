# Gloomy Invaders
## A Space Invaders Clone

### UPDATE: I packaged the thing into a setup executable, which can be found in [releases](https://github.com/BearHeathen/Gloomy-Invaders/releases).

#### NOTA BENE: Since the creation of this repo, BlitzBasic has been discontinued. You can still get it, however, [from this itch.io link](https://blitzresearch.itch.io/blitz3d). The original link is dead and points nowhere. It is kept for historical/nostalgic purposes. You can probably use the [WayBack Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to access it though!

*Gloomy Invaders* is a project created in Blitz3D, a dialect of BASIC available [here](https://www.blitzbasic.com/).
